## **Running the Application**

This application demonstrates the capability of the USB Host Stack to access and<br /> manage multiple USB Devices through a Hub. The demonstration application copies a file from<br /> one USB pen drive \(i.e.,a USB Flash storage device\) to another USB pen drive, where these<br /> pen drives are attached to a hub.

1.  Open the project in the MPLAB X IDE. Refer to [Building the Application](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/c%3A/H3_USB_APPS/usb_apps_host/apps/hub_msd/readme.md#building_the_application) section for available demo projects.
2.  Build the code and program the device.
3.  Connect a hub to the Host connector on the desired board.
4.  Connect a USB Pen drive containing an arbitrary file named "file.txt" to a spare port on the hub.
5.  Connect another USB pen drive to another spare port on the hub.
6.  The application will copy the file "file.txt" from the drive containing this file to the other drive. The copied file will be renamed as "newfile.txt". LED on the demonstration board will illuminate to indicate completion of the file transfer.
7.  Disconnect the drives and confirm demonstration success by inserting them into a personal computer and verifying the file transfer completed as expected.
8.  The demonstration application will always be in state where it waits for two pen drives to be connected to the hub and at least one of these pen drives contains a file named "file.txt".
