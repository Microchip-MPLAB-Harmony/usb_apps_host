## **Running the Application**

This application demonstrates the use of the MSD Host Class Driver to write a<br /> file to USB Flash drive. The application uses the USB Host\_layer, MSD class driver and the<br /> MPLAB Harmony File System Framework to enumerate a USB Flash drive and to write a file to<br /> it.

1.  Open the project with appropriate IDE. Compile the project and program the target device.
2.  With the code running, attach a USB Flash drive to the Host connector on the desired starter kit.
3.  The demonstration application will then create a file named file.txt. It will then write the text "Hello World" to this file, and then close the file.
4.  The LED on the selected hardware will indicate the status of the operation. Refer to the Configuring the Hardware instruction for details.
5.  The USB Flash drive can then be attached to a USB Host personal computer to verify the demonstration application operation.
6.  Steps 3 through 6 can be repeated.
7.  If the USB Flash drive already contains a file with the name file.txt, the demonstration application will append the text "Hello World" to the end of the file contents.
