## **Configuring the Hardware**

[**PIC32CZ CA80 Curiosity Development Board**](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ea61x20a)

-   Connect the USB device to the connector \(J102\) using a USB Type-A Female to micro-B male cable \(This cable is not included in the kit\).
-   LED0 on the board is controlled by the attached USB CDC device when a CDC device is attached. When a Mass Storage Device is attached, it indicates file write completion.

**[PIC32CX SG41 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev06x38a)**

-   Connect the USB device to the connector \(J200\) using a USB Type-A Female to micro-B male cable \(This cable is not included in the kit\).
-   LED2 on the board is controlled by the attached USB CDC device when a CDC device is attached. When a Mass Storage Device is attached, it indicates file write completion.

**[Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320209)**

-   Use the USB micro-B port J201 to connect the USB Device to the board. A USB Type-A Female to micro-B male cable will be needed to connect the device \(This cable is not included in the kit\).

**[Curiosity PIC32MX470 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/dm320103)**

-   Install a jumper in the J13 header to drive the VBUS line in Host mode.
-   Connect the USB device to the USB micro-AB connector J12 using a USB Type-A Female to micro-B male cable \(This cable is not included in the kit\).
-   LED1 on the board is controlled by the attached USB CDC device when a CDC device is attached. When a Mass Storage Device is attached, it indicates file write completion.

**[SAM9X75-DDR3-EB Evaluation Board](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/c%3A/H3_USB_APPS/usb_apps_host/apps/cdc_msd/readme.md)**

-   Powered the board with an external power supply \(or use the micro<br /> AB connector\).

-   Setup the SD card \(Note: exFAT formatted SD Cards are not<br /> supported\)

    -   Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_host/tree/master/deps/at91bootstrap_sam_9x7_binaries/boot.bin).
    -   Copy the downloaded boot loader binary \(boot.bin\) and generated application binary \(harmony.bin\) into the SD card.
    -   Insert the SD card into the SDMMC connector \(SDMMC0\) on the board.
    -   Reset the board by pressing the Push Button RESET, then START.
-   Connect an USB to serial cable to DBGU0 \(to enable debug com<br /> port\).

-   Connect the USB device to the Type-A connector or to the micro AB<br /> with a specific dongle \(in these case the need to be powered by the external<br /> power supply\).

-   LED near VDDCORE inscription on the board indicates the file write<br /> is complete.![](GUID-9267B813-42FC-4A89-A2CE-DF5AE7535C9C-low.png)**[SAMD21 Xplained Pro Board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamd21-xpro)**

    -   Jumper titled "PA03 SELECT" must be shorted between PA03 and USB\_ID\(positions 2 and 3\).
    -   Use "TARGET USB" connector on the board to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC. A USB micro AB to type A USB Host receptacle converter will be needed to connect the device.
    -   LED0 on the board is controlled by the attached USB CDC device when a CDC device is attached. When a Mass Storage Device is attached, it indicates file write completion.

        **Note:** Note: An unexpected behavior<br /> may be observed if the attached USB device draws an excess<br /> amount of current from the board and the Vdd voltage drops below<br /> 2.7 volts. The demo has the wait states \(NVM\_CTRLB<br /> <RWS\[3:0\]\>\) value set to '1'.

## **Running the Application**

This demonstration application creates a USB Host application that<br /> enumerates a CDC and a MSD Host. This application combines the functionality of the<br /> Host cdc\_basic and msd\_basic demonstration applications into one application. If a<br /> CDC device is connected, the demonstration application behaves like the cdc\_basic<br /> host application. If a MSD device is connected, the demonstration application<br /> behaves like the msd\_basic host application.

To exercise the CDC Host capabilities, refer to local documentation from<br /> [usb\_apps\_host/apps/cdc\_basic](GUID-33CDA167-6389-4F4C-8831-2962F864C071.md). The documentation is also available in the<br /> github path [usb\_apps\_host/apps/cdc\_basic](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_host/tree/master/apps/cdc_basic). To exercise the MSD Host<br /> capabilities, refer to local documentation from [usb\_apps\_host/apps/msd\_basic](GUID-F9D5AB11-B9C2-4E37-A971-FC12A540E307.md). The documentation is also available in<br /> the github path [usb\_apps\_host/apps/msd\_basic](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_host/tree/master/apps/msd_basic).
