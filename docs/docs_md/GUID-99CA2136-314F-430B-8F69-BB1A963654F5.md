## **Running the Application**

This application demonstrates the use of the MSD Host Class Driver to write a<br /> file to USB Flash drive. The application uses the USB Host\_layer, MSD class driver and the<br /> MPLAB Harmony File System Framework to enumerate a USB Flash drive and to write a file to<br /> it.

1.  Open the project with appropriate IDE. Compile the project and program the target device.
2.  With the code running, attach a USB Flash drive to the Host connector on the desired starter kit containing a non empty file named file.txt
3.  Attach a second empty USB Flash drive to another Host connector on the desired starter kit
4.  The demonstration application will then copy the file.txt from the first USB Flash drive to the second.
5.  The LED on the selected hardware will indicate the status of the operation.
6.  The second USB Flash drive can then be attached to a USB Host personal computer to verify the demonstration application operation.
