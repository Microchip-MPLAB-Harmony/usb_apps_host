# HID Basic Mouse USART Example \(hid\_basic\_mouse\_usart\)

This application demonstrates the use of the USB HID Host Client Driver to enumerate and<br /> operate a HID USB Mouse device.

## **Description**

This application uses the USB Host layer, HID Client driver and HID Mouse Usage driver to<br /> enumerate a USB Mouse and detect Mouse button press release events. The Mouse events are<br /> displayed using a terminal emulator on a personal computer.

## **Running the Application**

<br />

1.  Open the project with appropriate IDE. Compile the project and program the<br /> target device.

2.  Launch a terminal emulator, such as Tera Term. Select the appropriate COM<br /> port and set the serial port settings to 115200-N-1.

3.  If a USB mouse is not connected to the Host connector, the serial terminal<br /> emulator window will show the "Connect Mouse" prompt.

4.  Attach a USB mouse to the Host connector of the target hardware. Refer to<br /> the Configuring the Hardware section for any converter requirements. The message,<br /> "Mouse Connected", will display in the serial terminal emulator window.

5.  Begin moving the mouse and the appropriate relative coordinate changes for<br /> X,Y, and Z axes should be displayed in the serial terminal window.

6.  Click the mouse button to toggle LEDs on the board. Refer to the<br /> Configuring the Hardware section for details on the relevant LED.

7.  Disconnecting the mouse will result in the message, "Connect Mouse", to<br /> reappear on the serial console.
